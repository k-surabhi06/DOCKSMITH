DOCKSMITH
Project Requirements
1. Purpose
Docksmith is a simplified Docker-like build and runtime system built from scratch. You will understand
three things deeply: how build caching and content-addressing work, how process isolation works at the
OS level, and how images are assembled from layers and run as containers.
Out of scope: networking, image registries, resource limits, multi-stage builds, bind mounts, detached
containers, daemon processes.
2. Architecture
A single CLI binary — no daemon. All state lives in ~/.docksmith/ on disk.
Component Responsibility
docksmith (CLI) User-facing binary. Reads/writes state, invokes the build engine, runs containers
directly.
Build Engine Subsystem of the CLI. Parses Docksmithfile, manages layers and cache, executes
instructions in isolation, writes artifacts.
State directory layout:
~/.docksmith/
images/ # one JSON manifest per image
layers/ # content-addressed tar files named by digest
cache/ # index mapping cache keys to layer digests
3. Build Language
Files are named Docksmithfile. Every instruction below must be implemented. Any unrecognised
instruction fails immediately with a clear error and line number.
Instruction Required Behaviour
FROM Find the image in the local store (see section 4.3), use its layers as the base filesystem.
<image>[:<tag>] Fail with a clear error if the image is not found.
COPY <src> <dest> Copy files from the build context into the image. Supports * and ** globs. Creates
missing directories.
RUN <command> Execute a shell command inside the filesystem assembled so far — not on the host.
Result becomes a new image layer.
WORKDIR <path> Set the working directory for subsequent instructions.Does not produce a layer. If the
path does not exist in any previously extracted layer, the build engine creates it as an
empty directory in the temporary working filesystem immediately before the next

Instruction Required Behaviour
layer-producing instruction (COPY or RUN) executes. This creation is silent and not
stored as a tar delta.
ENV <key>=<value> Store an environment variable in the image config. Injected into every container from
this image. Does not produce a layer. These values are also injected into the
environment of every RUN command during build.
CMD Default command on container start when no override is given at runtime. JSON array
["exec","arg"] form required. Does not produce a layer.
Hard Requirement: RUN must execute inside the assembled layer filesystem, not on the host. The command
sees the image filesystem as its root with no access to host files.
Only these 6 instructions are required. EXPOSE, VOLUME, ADD, ARG, ENTRYPOINT, and SHELL are out of
scope.
4. Image Format
4.1 Manifest
Every image is a JSON file in images/:
{
"name": "myapp",
"tag": "latest",
"digest": "sha256:<hash>",
"created": "<ISO-8601>",
"config": {
"Env": ["KEY=value"],
"Cmd": ["python", "main.py"],
"WorkingDir": "/app"
},
"layers": [
{ "digest": "sha256:aaa...", "size": 2048, "createdBy": "<alpine layer 1>" },
{ "digest": "sha256:aca...", "size": 1024, "createdBy": "<alpine layer 2>" },
{ "digest": "sha256:bbb...", "size": 4096, "createdBy": "COPY . /app" },
{ "digest": "sha256:ccc...", "size": 8192, "createdBy": "RUN pip install ..." }
]
}
The size field for each layer entry is the byte size of its tar file on disk.
The manifest digest is computed as follows: serialize the manifest JSON with the digest field set to an
empty string "", compute the SHA-256 of that serialized bytes, then write the final manifest file with the
digest field set to "sha256:<computed_hash>". The digest field in the file on disk therefore reflects
the hash of the canonical form, not a hash of itself.
The number of inherited base layers depends on the base image — the example above is
illustrative only.
4.2 Layers
• COPY and RUN each produce a layer. Tar archive containing only the files added or modified by
that step (a delta, not a snapshot)
• Layers are stored in layers/ named by the SHA-256 digest of the tar's raw bytes.
• Layers are extracted in order; later layers overwrite earlier ones at the same path

• Layers are immutable once written. Identical filesystem content produces the same digest and
maps to one file on disk. Layers are not reference-counted; a layer file may be deleted by rmi even
if another image references the same digest.
• FROM reuses base image layers without creating a new one. WORKDIR, ENV, and CMD update
the image config only — they do not produce layers.
4.3 Base Images
You may use any base image(s) of your choice (e.g. a minimal Linux image, a Python image, etc).
Download them once as part of your initial setup and import them into the local store before any build is
attempted.
Hard Requirement: Do not download anything during build or run. All base images must be present in
~/.docksmith/ before any build is attempted. All operations must work fully offline.Your sample app (section 9) must
reference at least one base image via FROM.
5. Build Cache
The cache must be correct, deterministic, and reported to the user on every build.
5.1 Cache Key
A cache key is computed before each layer-producing instruction (COPY and RUN). A cache hit requires
the key to match an existing entry and the layer file to be present on disk. The key is a deterministic hash
of:
• Digest of the previous layer (or the base image's manifest digest for the first layer-producing
instruction — ensures FROM changes invalidate all downstream cache entries).
• The full instruction text as written in the Docksmithfile.
• Current WORKDIR value at the time the instruction is reached (empty string if not set).
• Current ENV state: all key=value pairs accumulated so far, serialized in lexicographically sorted key
order (empty string if none set).
• COPY only: SHA-256 of each source file's raw bytes, concatenated in lexicographically sorted path
order.
• "Previous layer" = the last COPY or RUN step; WORKDIR, ENV, and CMD are skipped when
walking back.
5.2 Rules & Output
Situation Behaviour
Cache hit Reuse the stored layer, skip re-execution. Print [CACHE HIT].
Cache miss Execute the instruction, store the resulting layer, update the cache index. Print
[CACHE MISS].
Cascade Once any step is a cache miss, all subsequent steps are also misses.
--no-cache Skip all cache lookups and writes for this build. Layers are still written to disk normally.
Example build output: Commands in RUN must not require network access. All dependencies must
be present in the build context or a prior layer. (if you have any pip install requirements, they
should be present in the context and cannot be pulled via the internet. )

FROM always prints its step line with no cache status or timing — it is not a layer-producing step and performs no
cache lookup.

A COPY source file changes That step and all below
Instruction text changes That step and all below
FROM image changes All layer-producing steps (via changed base digest in key)
Layer file missing from disk That step and all below (cascade applies)
--no-cache passed All steps
A WORKDIR value changes That step and all below
An ENV value changes That step and all below
6. Container Runtime
Requires Linux. macOS / Windows teams must use a Linux VM (WSL2, VirtualBox, etc). JUST USE A LINUX VM.
WSL has its own quirks.
To run a container: extract the image's layer tars in order into a temporary directory, isolate the process
into that root, apply ENV and WorkingDir, exec the command, wait for exit, print the exit code, and clean
up the temporary directory.
Hard Requirement: The container process must not read or write outside its assembled root. This is a pass/fail
criterion verified live during the demo.
Hard Requirement: The same isolation mechanism must be used for both RUN during build and docksmith run.
One primitive, used in two places. Skipping isolation during build does not satisfy this requirement.
• All image ENV values are injected into the process environment. -e KEY=VALUE overrides take
precedence over image ENV values.
• The working directory is set to the image's WorkingDir. Defaults to / if WorkingDir is not specified.
• No detached mode. The CLI blocks until the process exits.
• If no CMD is defined in the image and no command is given at docksmith run, fail with a clear error.
7. CLI Reference

Command / Flag Behaviour
docksmith images List all images in the local store. Columns: Name, Tag, ID (first 12 characters
of the digest), Created.
docksmith rmi Remove the image manifest and all of its layer files from disk. Fail with a clear
<name:tag> error if the image does not exist.
Note: no reference counting is performed. If multiple images share a layer,
deleting one image will remove the shared layer files
docksmith run Assemble the filesystem, start the container in the foreground, wait for exit.
<name:tag> [cmd] [cmd] overrides the image CMD. Fail with a clear error if no CMD is defined
and no [cmd] is provided.
-e KEY=VALUE Override or add an environment variable. Repeatable.
8. Constraints
Constraint Detail
No network access during No outbound requests during build or run. Base images are downloaded once
build or run during setup; after that, everything must work offline.
No existing runtimes Do not invoke Docker, runc, containerd, or any other container tool. Implement
isolation directly using OS primitives.
Immutable layers Once written, a layer is never modified. Layers are stored once per digest but are
not reference-counted. rmi deletes the layer files belonging to the removed image.
If another image references the same layer digest, that layer file will be gone and
that image will be broken. This is expected behavior.
RUN isolation RUN during build executes inside the image filesystem using the same isolation
mechanism as docksmith run.
Verified isolation A file written inside a container must not appear on the host filesystem. Pass/fail at
demo.
Reproducible builds The same Docksmithfile and the same source files must produce identical layer
digests and an identical manifest on every build on the same machine. Hint: tar
entries must be added in a consistent sorted order with file timestamps zeroed —
otherwise the digest will differ between runs and the cache will never hit.
Manifest timestamp The created field is set once at first build and preserved on cache-hit rebuilds.
When all steps are cache hits, the manifest is rewritten with the original created
value so the manifest digest remains identical across rebuilds on the same
machine.
9. Sample App & Demo
Include a sample app in the repo that builds and runs using only Docksmith with no manual setup beyond
the initial base image import.
• The Docksmithfile must use all six instructions: FROM, COPY, RUN, WORKDIR, ENV, CMD.
• FROM must reference one of your chosen base images.

• At least one ENV value must be overridable via -e at runtime to demonstrate the override
behaviour.
• All dependencies must be bundled — no network access during build or run. The app must produce
visible output.
# Command / Action Demonstrates
1 docksmith build -t myapp:latest All layer-producing steps show [CACHE MISS]. Build completes with total
. (cold build) time printed.
2 docksmith build -t myapp:latest All layer-producing steps show [CACHE HIT]. Build completes
. (warm build) near-instantly.
3 Edit a source file, then rebuild The affected step and all steps below it show [CACHE MISS]. Steps
above it show [CACHE HIT].
4 docksmith images The image is listed with correct Name, Tag, ID (12-char digest prefix), and
Created timestamp.
5 docksmith run myapp:latest Container starts, produces visible output, and exits cleanly.
6 docksmith run -e KEY=newVal The env override is applied correctly inside the container.
myapp:latest
7 Write a file inside the container, PASS / FAIL: the file must not appear anywhere on the host filesystem.
then check the host
8 docksmith rmi myapp:latest The image manifest and all associated layer files are removed from
~/.docksmith/.
TL;DR- What You Are Building & What Is Expected
You are building three things:
1. A build system that reads a Docksmithfile and executes six instructions: FROM, COPY, RUN,
WORKDIR, ENV, and CMD. Each COPY and RUN produces an immutable delta layer stored as a
content-addressed tar file under
~/.docksmith/layers/. The final image is a JSON manifest in ~/.docksmith/images/ listing all layers and
config.
2. A build cache that is deterministic and correct. Before every COPY or RUN, a cache key is computed
from the previous layer's digest (or the base image's manifest digest for the very first layer-producing
instruction) + the instruction text + the current WORKDIR value at the time the instruction is reached
(empty string if not set) + the current ENV state accumulated so far, serialized in lexicographically sorted
key order (empty string if no ENV has been set) + (for COPY) the hash of source files in lexicographically
sorted order. A hit reuses the stored layer and prints [CACHE HIT]. A miss executes, stores, and prints
[CACHE MISS]. Any miss cascades all steps below it to misses. Builds must be byte-for-byte
reproducible: tar entries sorted, timestamps zeroed (important).
3. A container runtime that assembles the image filesystem by extracting all layer tars in order into a
temporary directory, then isolates a process into that root (Linux process isolation). The same isolation
primitive must be used for both RUN during build and docksmith run. A file written inside a container must
not appear on the host. This is a hard pass/fail at the demo.
